                    Closure may mean different things for different people. For me it means distancing myself from the world. I want to let go of everything i am holding because i feel tired. Sometimes i think of giving up everything just to be free. I am happy to have the possibility to express myself through words. Then again it does not make me feel free to just say what i feel. I want sometime for myself doing nothing just being myself. 
                                                                    	</p>
                                                                    	<br>

Another person iknow told me what closure for him was. It is like being inside a jail where you can see the greenery outside but are feeling captured. My hope for an angle remains intact because hope is everything. Have hope and everything might work out eventually. Stay strong because closure within is a difficult subject.

They were invisible souls for eachother and i believe the worst part was the invisibke souls did not realise they were invisible. So they did what was expected of them. Put up a facade and a smile like it did not hurt anywhere. That is the main reason i am thinking of being a lonely soul. It might make my life easier to live and overcome challenges. I want to be a lonely soul.
